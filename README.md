# ToDoListApp
Project for Ionic module

This is a simple to-do-list app.

It has 5 different views, using a sidemenu as the template.

The views are:

1 - Display all tasks

2 - Display just the work tasks (can add new tasks here)

3 - Display just the personal tasks (can add new tasks here)

4 - Display just the completed tasks

5 - Settings option (different sorting and reseting options here)

The app uses html local storage to store tasks used in previous sessions.
